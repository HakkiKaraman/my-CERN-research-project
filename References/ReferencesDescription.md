The references are the original paper from Taubin 1991 - 'Estimation of Planar Curves, Surfaces, and Nonplanar Space Curves Defined by Implicit Equations with Applications to Edge and Range Image Segmentation' that described geometric fitting method in more general terms. Furthermore, there are my derivations for 3D case with the name 'Hakki Karaman's Derivations for Trivariate Implicit Full Quadric Surface Fitting (Taubin's Method)'
